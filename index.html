						<h1>Need Blood ?</h1>
						<p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into
						biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components).
						Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (the latter called apheresis). Blood banks often
						participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.Today in the developed world,
						most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established
						supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).
						Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some
						cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for
						their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the
						needle is inserted or may feel faint.Potential donors are evaluated for anything that might make their blood unsafe
						to use. The screening includes testing for diseases that can be transmitted by a blood transfusion, including HIV and
						viral hepatitis. The donor must also answer questions about medical history and take a short physical examination to
						make sure the donation is not hazardous to his or her health. How often a donor can donate varies from days to months 
						based on what component they donate and the laws of the country where the donation takes place. For example, in the
						United States, donors must wait eight weeks (56 days) between whole blood donations but only seven days between
						plateletpheresis donations and twice per seven-day period in plasmapheresis.</p>
